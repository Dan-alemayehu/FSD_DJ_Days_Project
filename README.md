# FSD DJ Days Project

Create a project that holds some of your favorite albums!

#### Note:
Refer back to the pet directory in-class demo for ideas...

## Instructions

Don't edit:
-*index.html* 
-*stylesheet.css*

-If there are less than 10 albums: show message to say you need more albums. 
-If there are 10 albums or more, show message to say ready to start playing music!

## *albums.js*
-Make array of 5 'album' objects. 
-Each object with these properties:
- name
- artist
- genre

Optionally: add an "artwork" property with album cover.

#### Note:


## *albumListing.js*
- "for loop" to list *albums in albums.js*
- If there are less than 10 albums: show *<h4>* message to say "You need more albums!"
- Otherwise, show message to say *<h4>*"Let's start playing music!"

#### Notes:

- You already have the variable *"html"* that can be used to create the album listings for the DOM, as well as the code to produce whatever content the variable *"html"* has
- The *<h4>* message variables have also been included
